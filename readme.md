# Sensor Examples   

A collection of bare-bones examples to get various sensors working on Arduino miceocontrollers. In some cases, I find the examples that come with different libraries can be simplified, so I write my own versions to do so. Links back to the original library are included in the header for each example. 

A few categories have dedicated pages:

* [Accelerometers](Accelerometers)
* [Force Sensing Potentiometers](ForceSensingPotentiometer)
* [Joystick](Joystick)
* [Light Sensors](LightSensors)
* [Spectral Sensors](LightSensors/spectral-sensors.md)
* [MPX2102 Pressure Sensor ](PressureSensorMPX2102)
