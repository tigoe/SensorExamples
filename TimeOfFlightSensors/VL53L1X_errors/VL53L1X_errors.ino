/*
  VL53L1X Time-of-flight error message
  and timing budget adjustment example
  Uses Sparkfun's VL53L1X library: http://librarymanager/All#SparkFun_VL53L1X
  Prints the distance to an object in mm

  This example reads the distance even if the ranging status is in error.
  Using a timing budget of 500ms, I was able to read distances up to 4m
  reasonably accurately (~5cm) even when the error code was reading "Signal failure"
  
  The circuit:
  - VL53L1X SDA connected to SDA (A4)
  - VL53L1X SCL connected to SCL (A5)

  based on Sparkfun examples by Nathan Seidle
