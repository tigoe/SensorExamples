/*
  Ohmite FSP test for FSP01CE/FSP02CE sensor

  This example shows how to read position and force on a force-sensing potentiometer. \
  Running a finger up and down the sensor results in a position value from 0 to 100.
  Pressing on the sensor produces a force value that varies from 0 to about 3.
  It uses the M2aglabs_Ohmite library by Marc Graham:
  https://github.com/m2ag-labs/m2aglabs_ohmite
  https://m2aglabs.com/2019/08/14/using-ohmite-force-sensitive-potentiometers/

  The circuit:
  - 10Kohm resistor connects Vref (pin A3) to wiper (pin A2)
  - sensor wiper (pin 1): A2
  - sensor V2 (pin 2): A1
  - sensor V1 (pin 3): A0
  Note: only wiper needs to be on an analog pin, others can be digital pins
